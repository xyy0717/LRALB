# Algorithm Descriptions

This document provides a detailed description of the comparative algorithms and related parameter settings used in this paper, covering multi-label feature selection (MFS), partial multi-label learning (PML), and partial multi-label feature selection (PMFS).

**GRRO.** GRRO jointly considers feature relevance, label relevance, and feature redundancy in a unified optimization framework to efficiently obtain globally optimal feature subsets. By optimizing global relevance and redundancy relationships, it aims to select informative features while suppressing redundant ones in multilabel learning tasks. Its parameters $\alpha_1$ and $\beta$ are tuned within $\{0.001, 0.01, \ldots, 1000\}$ to achieve optimal performance.

**SSFS.** SSFS captures the shared latent structure between features and labels by introducing a constrained latent structure shared term. It further incorporates graph regularization to preserve structural information, so that selected features can better reflect the intrinsic relationship between the feature space and the label space. Its parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are tuned within $\{0.001, 0.01, \ldots, 1000\}$ to achieve optimal performance.

**fPML.** fPML is a feature-induced partial multi-label learning method that exploits feature information to assist label disambiguation. It models the relationship between instances and candidate labels, and uses feature-induced evidence to estimate credible labels from partially labeled data. Its parameters are set as $\lambda_1=1$, $\lambda_2=1$, and $\lambda_3=10$.

**PML-LCom.** PML-LCom improves partial multi-label learning by using label compression to reduce label ambiguity and capture label correlations. It jointly optimizes the compressed label representation, the recovered label matrix, and the predictive model, thereby enhancing learning performance when only candidate labels are available. Its parameters are set as $\lambda_1=5$, $\lambda_2=10$, and $\lambda_3=0.1$.

**NLR.** NLR focuses on noisy label removal for partial multi-label learning. It identifies and removes false-positive labels from the candidate label set while exploiting the remaining reliable label information for model learning. This makes it suitable for PML scenarios where observed candidate labels may contain substantial noise. Its parameters are set as $\beta=10$, $\gamma=10$, and $\lambda=2$.

**FastGRAIL.** FastGRAIL is an anchor-graph-based fast adaptive partial multi-label learning method with label correlations. It uses anchor graphs to improve computational efficiency and adaptively explores label correlation information to support label disambiguation and prediction. Its parameters are set as $\gamma=1$, $\eta=0.1$, $\lambda=1$, and $\rho=100$.

**PML-FSLA.** PML-FSLA reconsiders feature structure information and latent space alignment in partial multi-label feature selection. It aligns the feature and label spaces in a latent representation while preserving feature structure information, so that discriminative features can be selected under ambiguous partial multi-label supervision. Its parameters are set as $\alpha=100$, $\beta=1$, and $\gamma=10$.

**DGLFS.** DGLFS performs dual-space guided global-local disambiguation for partial multi-label feature selection. It jointly exploits information from both feature and label spaces, combines global and local disambiguation mechanisms, and selects features that are more robust to noisy candidate labels. Its parameters are set as $\lambda_1=10$, $\lambda_2=0.0001$, and $\lambda_3=0.01$.
